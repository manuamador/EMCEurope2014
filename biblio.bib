	Abstract = {For interval estimation of a proportion, coverage probabilities tend
	to be too large for "exact" confidence intervals based on inverting
	the binomial test and too small for the interval based on inverting
	the Wald large-sample normal test (i.e., sample proportion $\pm$
	z-score Ã— estimated standard error). Wilson's suggestion of inverting
	the related score test with null rather than estimated standard error
	yields coverage probabilities close to nominal confidence levels,
	even for very small sample sizes. The 95% score interval has similar
	behavior as the adjusted Wald interval obtained after adding two
	"successes" and two "failures" to the sample. In elementary courses,
	with the score and adjusted Wald methods it is unnecessary to provide
	students with awkward sample size guidelines.},

	new demands on the manufacturer to prove reliability and safety of

	when trying to prove immunity against electromagnetic disturbances

@article{Gifuni11,
	Abstract = {In this study, we propose a deterministic approach to estimate the
	upper bound of the electric field in a reverberation chamber (RC),
	where the field is well stirred. That approach is based on the plane
	wave integral representation for fields in an RC, assuming the ergodicity
	of the first two moments of the amplitude of the angular spectrum,
	which includes an energy constraint. Also, we consider further hypotheses
	on a sample function of the angular spectrum, such as a conditional
	phase and polarization, and the type of probability density function
	(PDF) of its amplitude. First, we calculate the maximum value of
	the electric field as a function of its root mean square value and
	of the inverse of the variation coefficient of the PDF of the considered
	sample function's amplitude. Then, we consider both the realistic
	values and the extreme value of the inverse of the variation coefficient
	in order to achieve the upper bound of the electric field as an extreme
	event of a statistical model with finite energy. Finally, we achieve
	an upper bound of the electric field as a function of its root mean
	square value only and we point out that it is consistent with respect
	to the results available in bibliography, both experimental and theoretical.},

@inproceedings{Harrington00,
	Abstract = {Reverberation chambers historically have been used for military and
	aerospace radiated immunity testing, but their use for commercial
	radiated emissions testing is attracting attention. In contrast to
	the usual open-area-test-site-type radiated-emissions test, which
	measures electric field at some distance, a reverb chamber measures
	the total radiated power from an equipment-under-test. The widely
	used GTEM cell three-position emissions test method is also based
	on a total-radiated-power measurement. This paper presents preliminary
	total radiated power measured from dipole and slotted-box radiators
	in GTEM cells and reverberation chambers in the 80-1000 MHz frequency
	range. Measured results for typical multiposition GTEM-to-OATS and
	free-space correlation schemes are presented. An EUT directivity
	estimation scheme for power-to-field conversion is reviewed and compared
	to the GTEM algorithm using data from the same canonical radiators.
	FDTD-calculated free-space directivity for a slotted-box radiator
	is compared to the theory. Good agreement is shown between the various

	by plane waves it is necessary to increase the test level, i.e. add
	a margin. In order to find out typical magnitudes of this margin
	coupling measurements to the interior of several objects have been
	carried out both in mode-stirred and anechoic chamber (AC). The results
	show that the maximum coupling in the anechoic chamber is 10-15 dB
	higher than the coupling measured in the mode-stirred chamber. Also,
	the assumption of isotropic field conditions in the mode-stirred
	chamber is strongly supported by the measurements. Finally, it is
	shown that the statistical distribution of the equipment's internal
	field when rotating the stirrer in an MSC is not the same as when
	the angle of incidence is varied in an AC},

	Abstract = {Among the significant characteristics of the electromagnetic environment
	in a reverberation chamber are isotropy, random polarization and

	These characteristics have been repeatedly demonstrated for frequencies
	where the chamber is highly overmoded. In this case, the statistical
	electromagnetic test environment can be described in terms of a chi-square
	distribution. However, the maximum value of the test environment,
	which is generally the parameter of most interest for immunity testing,

	function for the maximum to mean ratio for an overmoded reverberation

@article{Orjubin07c,
	Abstract = {Classically, the statistical model of the maximum field inside a reverberation
	chamber (RC) is derived from the field magnitude model that is only
	known for the overmoded RC. We propose in this paper to model the
	maximum field by the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution,
	as an application of the Fisher-Tippett theorem that formulates the
	asymptotic distributions of sample maximum. As the knowledge of the
	parent distribution (field magnitude) is not required, the GEV distribution
	is suitable for both overmoded and undermoded regimes (few modes
	excited). A Monte Carlo simulation illustrates the use of the GEV
	distribution for the overmoded RC. Modal FEM analysis of the RC extends
	the application to the undermoded regime. Special attention is brought
	to the issue of GEV parameter estimation: The so-called L-moments
	technique is advantageously employed to estimate the parameters from
	the small data sample. Dispersion of the estimated parameters is
	approximated and reduced by averaging uncorrelated values obtained
	from a narrow frequency band},
